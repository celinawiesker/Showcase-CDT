          <h2>Major Problems I discovered during the Project</h2>
          <p class="separator">In the course of this project I came across some smaller and bigger problems. Belwo I
            listed the major issues I had to solve. I tried to give a short overview on my process and how I fixed the
            problems. In general I can say that solving the difficulties was not easy but it tought me a lot.

              <h4>Unity Crash</h4>
              <p><br>I had the problem that unity suddenly crashed on my tablet. I tried to reinstall it and bought an
                SD
                card to extend the storage capacity. In the end I was not able to solve the problem and switched to
                Phaser.</p>

              <h4>Choosing and Adapting to versions</h4>
              <p>After the switch to Phaser I had to decide which version to use. Afterwards I often came across
                examples which were fitting well but written in the wrong version. I had to google a lot to adat it to
                the 3rd version but it worked out.</p>

              <h4>Finding suitable sources</h4>
              <p>Throughout the whole project it was very difficult to find Phaser instructions which were easy to
                understand for beginners. The tutorials often expected a certain preknowledge. I just kept on googling
                and trying.</p>

              <h4>Debugging</h4>
              <p><br>Debugging the code has felt as if it was the main activity of this project besides googling. I
                debugged
                a lot and it was often times a really big problem. I had quite a few difficulties even understanding
                what was ment with the errors.</p>

              <h4>Formatting with phaser</h4>
              <p>To format the scenes in the way I imagined I first had to understand how phaser works and how I could
                position elements. That was really difficult to understand. In the end I found out that for loops are my
                best friends.</p>

              <h4>Create Match function</h4>
              <p><br>The match function was a really heavy struggle I solved by using ids on the loaded images. I
                compared
                if the first cards clicked is the same as the second card clicked and thus I was able to detect a match.

              <h4>Create Scenes</h4>
              <p><br>In Phaser there is a function to create new scenes. In the beginning of my project I created
                different games but as I wanted to connect them with each other I had to change the structure to scenes.
                Now I can switch between them easily.</p>

              <h4>Implementing drop zones</h4>
              <p>The drop interaction swas created with arrays that stored the inromation for the shells and stones, a
                randomize function and for loop. Afterwards the drop zone was created with code from the internet the
                ids previously assigned to the items are checked to detect a match</p>
